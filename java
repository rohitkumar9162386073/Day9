1. Create a Functional Interface with the name ‘ConcatString’ as given below:
Implement this Interface as Lambda and use it to concatenate two strings.
2. Use Predicate Interface to perform the following:
a Check whether a number is divisible by 5.
b Check whether a number is divisible by 2.
c Check whether a number is divisible by both 2 and 5.
d Check whether a number is divisible by 2 or 5.
3. Create an array of Customer objects for the class created in Day 2 assignment and print all 
those customers whose monthly income is greater than 5lac per annum. Create your own 
Functional Interface and implement it. 
4. Use the same interface to print all those customers whose age is in range of 18 to 25. 
5. Create an array of LoanAgreement class objects and print all those Loan accounts whose status 
is ‘Active’ and whose EMI is pending. Use the ‘Predicate’ Functional Interface to achieve the 
same. 
6. Java contains an interface ‘Comparator’ to compare two objects. Create a sort method to sort 
the LoanAgreement array based on Loan amount descending using the Comparator interface.
